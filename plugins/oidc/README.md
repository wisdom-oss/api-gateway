## About
This plugin intercepts every call to the API and checks the `Authorization`
header and the JWT (JSON Web Token) contained in it.
The JWT is validated using the JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) available on the endpoint
specified in the plugin configuration.
The JWKS is downloaded once at the first request the plugin intercepts and will
be stored on disk, to limit the needed network requests to external servers and
therefore speeding up the validation of the tokens.
After the JWT has been validated, it will be used to access the information
about a user that is available under the configured user info endpoint.
These responses can optionally be cached using a redis database to further
minimize the number of network requests executed for each intercepted request.

## Configuration
The configuration is done by the 
[watchdog](https://github.com/wisdom-oss/watchdog) on a service-by-service
basis.
Please refer to the documentation of the watchdog for further information.
